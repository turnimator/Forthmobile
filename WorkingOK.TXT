( GPS still on development , works ok ) 

when Forthmobilev3.5 starts it opens a serial port2 to 9600 baud 
the GPS NEO 6 shall be connected RTX2 and TX2 pins

( rr and vv are abreviations )  

I execute by hand RR and again and again, 
till I see on the screen the message 
." IS A VALID COMMAND"
( in the future  RR should run inside a LOOP and 
after reading the Checksum  ,  values are sepparated
from the main string in BUFF1  with "VV" , all automatically) 

For now :
." IS A VALID COMMAND"  means 
on the Serial2 continuous stream of data sent by the GPS
we have  detected $GPGGA,  which means follows a valid lat&long position command

all commands sent by the GPS have  data with integer part and decimal part, 
so I did 3 values for each position number  + 1 value more for a Char N  S  W  O 
 longitude = GPSlong1 GPSlong2 GPSlong3
 latitude  = GPSlat1  GPSlat2  GPSlat3

 GPSlong3 is W or O  and GPSlat3 = N or S  (both as char value)

 GPSTIME is a full integer 32bit without the decimal part, I drop those 2 decimals.

So after RR shows me ." Is a valid command"   I execute  VV  ( View View)
 
to "view" and store the data inside the 7 values.
 
VV  reads the BUFF1 with the raw  command string and sepparates 
values up to "," and up to "." , then calls " convertgps "
 
if you want to print  the conversion result do   " print-gps$ "
 
if you have connected an OLED do  " latoled "
it will print position lat long and  N S W O on the Oled

I tested simoultaneous TOF laser value and Compass values,  all 3 sensors
work well together, and I can print all values together on the OLED.
So I tested 4 devices on the same I2C bus, without any problem.

(I tested also the Gyroscope together on I2c Bus and it did work well,without
conflicts  but I did not do  the words from Forth to read it)
